# UE5/C++ - Parkour, Traversal and Climbing  

This project is focused on developing advanced parkour and traversal mechanics in Unreal Engine using C++. The goal is to create a seamless, dynamic movement system inspired by parkour-based games like *Assassin's Creed*, *Mirrorâ€™s Edge*, and *Dying Light*. The project emphasizes procedural generation of climbing routes and traversal systems to enable characters to fluidly navigate through varied environments, including vertical surfaces, ledges, and obstacles.

### Features

	- Procedural Climbing: Automatically detect and generate climbing paths based on environment geometry.
	- Parkour Movements : Includes wall running, vaulting, sliding, and free running animations.
	- Traversal System : Allows fluid movement transitions between ground, walls, and ledges.
	- Animation Blueprint :  Custom procedural animation for seamless player movement, avoiding pre-baked animations for maximum flexibility.
	- Environmental Interaction : Characters dynamically respond to objects, slopes, and other environmental factors during traversal.
